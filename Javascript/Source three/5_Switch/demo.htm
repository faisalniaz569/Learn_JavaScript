    <!--
    Syntax:

        switch(expression) {
        case x:
        // code block
        break;
        case y:
        // code block
        break;
        default:
        // code block
        }
        
        This is how it works:

        . The switch expression is evaluated once.
        . The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
        . If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
        . If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

    <p>

        The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.

        (Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

        This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:
    </p>

    <h2>JavaScript switch</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        let day;
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
            case 0:
                day = "Sunday";
                break;
            case 1:
                day = "Monday";
                break;
            case 2:
                day = "Tuesday";
                break;
            case 3:
                day = "Wednesday";
                break;
            case 4:
                day = "Thursday";
                break;
            case 5:
                day = "Friday";
                break;
            case 6:
                day = "Saturday";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Today is " + day;
