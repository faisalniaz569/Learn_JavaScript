    <h2>JavaScript switch</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <!--<p>
        When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

        This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

        It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
