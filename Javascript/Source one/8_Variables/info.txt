Variables are Containers for Storing Data.

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

   * Automatically
   * Using var
   * Using let
   * Using const


# The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

# The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

# The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.


## When use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables,

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.


## Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

Example: 
Cannot do this.

let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0;

## Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

Example:

var x = "John Doe";
var x = 0;



## JavaScript Identifiers -

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

   . Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
   . Names must begin with a letter.
   . Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
   . Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
   . Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
   
   
## Const keyword cannot be reassigned:

const PI = 3.14159265359;


Use const when you declare:

   . A new Array
   . A new Object
   . A new Function
   . A new RegExp (Regular expression)
