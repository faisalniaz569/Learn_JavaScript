    <h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
    <p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers and produces a new number.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
        let x = 100 + 50;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;


        let a = 200;
        let b = 150;
        let c = a + b;

        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = c;


        let k = 3;
        let l = (8 + 5) * k;

        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = l;

            The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

            The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.
