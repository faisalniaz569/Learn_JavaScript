    <h2>JavaScript Arrays</h2>

    <p>
        JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

        Array items are separated by commas.

        The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):
    </p>

    <p>Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.</p>
    
    <p>
        cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    </p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];

    </script>
