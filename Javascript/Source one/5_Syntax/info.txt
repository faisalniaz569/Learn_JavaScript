* JavaScript syntax is the set of rules.

// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;


The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

  * Fixed values,
  * Variable values
  

# Fixed values are called Literals.
# Variable values are called Variables.

Example:

* Fixed values - 
1. Numbers:
1000, 10.5

2. Strings -
"John Doe", 'John Doe'

* Variable values -

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6.

Example: x = 6.


** JavaScript Operators -
1. Arithmatic operator(+ - * /)
2. Assignment operator(=)


*** JavaScript Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

   => A letter (A-Z or a-z)
   => A dollar sign ($)
   => Or an underscore (_)
   
   
# Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.


# Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
