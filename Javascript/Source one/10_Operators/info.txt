1) Assignment Operators 
2) Arithmetic Operators 
3) Comparison Operators
4) String Operators

-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication

Operator	Example	    Same As
=	        x = y	    x = y
+=	        x += y	    x = x + y
-=	        x -= y	    x = x - y
*=	        x *= y	    x = x * y
/=	        x /= y	    x = x / y
%=	        x %= y	    x = x % y
**=	        x **= y	    x = x ** y

3) Comparison Operators:

==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator
