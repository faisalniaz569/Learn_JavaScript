    <!--
       <p>
                Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

        Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

        JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

        In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.   
        
        
        The Difference Between Arrays and Objects:
        
        ** In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

        ** In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
        
        When to Use Arrays? When to use Objects?

        => JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
        => You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
        => You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
